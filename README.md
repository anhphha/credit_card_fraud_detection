# credit_card_fraud_detection

Kaggle challenge | Tools: Python | Project is about to handle imbalanced dataset of credit card transactions and detect fraud transactions from the dataset mixed with normal transactions
- Preprocessed imbalanced dataset via undersampling, oversampling (SMOTE) and conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Implemented various models to classify the two transaction clusters, compare models' performance (ROC, AUC, Precision, Recall, f1) in detecting fraud transactions 
- Tested Neural Networks on Random UnderSampling vs OverSampling (SMOTE) data
